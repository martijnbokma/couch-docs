It is common now to find websites integrating with Google Maps. The **Contact Us** page usually displays one although maps are often also found associated with individual items being represented by pages e.g. properties, members etc.

Couch abstracts away the complexity of creating a Google map behind a simple tag - the [**google_map**](../../tags-reference/google_map/) tag.

You'll need a key from Google to use its API. If you don't have one, get one free from the site mentioned below and set it at the following location `config.php`:

```php title="config.php"
// 16.
// Google Maps API Key.
// You'll have to get one for your site from 'http://code.google.com/apis/maps/'
// if your site makes use of Google maps.
define( 'K_GOOGLE_KEY', 'ABQIAAAAD7z_FToS5NSqosnG9No1ABQYPrehWcZJH1ec0SZqipYFbK_nfRT1ryCGKzl5KGpFG3y5jyPe_uClVg' );
```

The following snippet will quickly create a map showing the given address:

```php title="Basic Map Example"
<cms:google_map
    name='my_map'
    address='1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA'
/>
```

You can use the latitude and longitude of a place instead of its address:

```php title="Map with Coordinates"
<cms:google_map
    name='my_map'
    latitude='37.423021'
    longitude='-122.083739'
/>
```

For a comprehensive list of all parameters supported by the `google_map` tag, please refer to the [**google_map**](../../tags-reference/google_map/).
