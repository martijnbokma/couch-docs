From what we have read so far, we know that a template can be either *clonable* or *non-clonable*. A *clonable* template will necessarily have cloned pages associated with it hence it is said to be executing within a *page-view* when a cloned page of it is accessed while it is said to be executing within a *list-view* if it is accessed in a stand alone manner.

A *non-clonable* template always represents one single page and hence it has no such views associated with it.

:::note[Template Context]
Depending on whether a template is clonable or non-clonable and upon the view it is being executed in, each time a template is accessed, Couch makes available certain variables that are relevant to the template's state.
:::

For example, when executed in a *page-view*, a template is used to access a cloned page and hence all that cloned page's data (including all its editable region's contents) are made available by Couch for use by your script.

In contrast, when executed in a *list-view*, it is not any single page that is accessed and hence no such page specific data is made available. Instead, certain variables that describe the 'list-view' and make it easy for your script to actually 'list' the pages pertaining to the view, are made available.

A complete list of all the variables that become available during the above mentioned conditions are listed below.

For the sake of this example we make use of a template named `blog.php` that has three editable regions defined within it - *my_blog_text*, *my_blog_image* and *my_blog_author* (these will be made available as variables with the same names. They are shown highlighted below).

## Global Variables

The following variables are available in ALL cases, irrespective of the clonable status of the template and the current view:

- `k_page_link`
- `k_admin_link`
- `k_site_link`
- `k_admin_path`
- `k_site_path`
- `k_template_title`
- `k_template_name`
- `k_template_id`
- `k_template_link`
- `k_prettyurls`
- `k_site_charset`
- `k_email_from`
- `k_email_to`
- `k_is_commentable`

## Non-Clonable Template Variables

If `blog.php` is non-clonable, it can only be accessed as:

```txt title="Non-Clonable URL"
https://www.mysite.com/blog.php
```

Available variables in this case are:

- `k_is_list_page`
- `k_comments_count`
- `k_page_date`
- `k_page_modification_date`
- `my_blog_text`
- `my_blog_image`
- `my_blog_author`

## Clonable Template Views

If `blog.php` is made clonable, different views become available, each with its own set of variables:

### Page View

Example URL:

```txt title="Page View URL"
https://www.mysite.com/blog/some_page_name.html
```

In this view, variables giving information about the current page, the containing folder (if the page resides in one) and the contents of the page's editable regions are made available.

#### Page Information Variables

The folowing variables carry information about the page in question:

- `k_is_page`
- `k_page_title`
- `k_page_name`
- `k_page_id`
- `k_page_date`
- `k_page_modification_date`
- `k_comments_count`

#### Folder Information Variables

The following variables carry Information about the folder, if the page resides in one:

- `k_page_folderid`
- `k_page_foldername`
- `k_page_foldertitle`
- `k_page_folderlink`
- `k_page_folderpagecount`
- `k_page_foldertotalpagecount`

#### Editable Region Variables

Finally the contents of editable regions:

- `my_blog_text`
- `my_blog_image`
- `my_blog_author`

### Folder View

Example URL:

```txt title="Folder View URL"
https://www.mysite.com/blog/some_subfolder/
```

In this view, variables giving information about the folder mentioned in the URL are set:

- `k_is_list`
- `k_is_folder`
- `k_folder_id`
- `k_folder_name`
- `k_folder_title`
- `k_folder_link`
- `k_folder_pagecount` (Number of pages in the folder)
- `k_folder_totalpagecount` (Total number of pages, including pages in subfolders)

### Archive View

Example URL:

```txt title="Archive View URL"
https://www.mysite.com/blog/2010/05/
```

In this view, variables giving information about the archive's time period (as given in the URL) are set:

- `k_is_list`
- `k_is_archive`
- `k_archive_date`
- `k_next_archive_date`
- `k_archive_link`
- `k_day`
- `k_month`
- `k_year`

### Home View

Example URL:

```txt title="Home View URL"
https://www.mysite.com/blog/
```

- `k_is_list`
- `k_is_home`
- `k_folder_pagecount` (Number of pages. Remember home view is also the root folder)
- `k_folder_totalpagecount` (Total number of cloned pages, including pages in subfolders)

:::danger[Important]
For clonable templates, the contents of the editable regions associated with a page are made available only in page view.
:::

:::tip[Debug Variables]
You can use the Couch tags [**dump**](../../tags-reference/dump/) and [**dump_all**](../../tags-reference/dump_all/) to see for yourself all the variables with their current values.

Next is [**Listing Pages**](../listing-pages/)
