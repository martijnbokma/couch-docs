## Cart Calculations

### Basic Calculations

- `pp_count_items`: Total number of items in cart
- `pp_count_unique_items`: Number of unique products
- `pp_count_shippable_items`: Number of items requiring shipping
- `pp_sub_total`: Cart subtotal
- `pp_discount`: Applied discounts
- `pp_sub_total_discounted`: Subtotal after discounts
- `pp_taxes`: Calculated taxes
- `pp_shipping`: Shipping charges
- `pp_total`: Final total

### Cart Actions

- `pp_refresh_cart`: Refreshes cart calculations
- `pp_empty_cart`: Clears the cart
- `pp_cart_link`: Links to cart page
- `pp_add_item_link`: Adds items to cart
- `pp_update_item_link`: Updates cart items
- `pp_remove_item_link`: Removes items from cart

## Configuration

CouchCart can be configured through the `config.php` file in the `addons/cart` directory. This allows you to set up:

- Currency settings
- PayPal configuration
- Shipping calculations
- Tax rates
- Discount rules

## Best Practices

While dedicated scripts like osCommerce or Magento have their places, they seem overkill for sites requiring only basic e-commerce facility.
CouchCMS now ships with a shopping cart component designed to fill this niche - CouchCart.

True to CouchCMS's philosophy where it is your design that always takes center-stage (the CMS always getting 'retrofitted' within the existing HTML markup), CouchCart simply provides a set of tags that can be added to any HTML shopping cart design to convert it into a fully functional e-store in no time.

To demonstrate the use of these tags, we created a tutorial that takes a sample HTML template (kindly provided by [@cheesypoof](https://www.couchcms.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=11919)) and converts it into a working e-commerce site.

The tutorial is available [here](../../tutorials/shopping-cart/shopping-cart-1/).
