To start working with Couch, you need a regular HTML coded site. For example, your site might have several HTML files:
- `index.html`
- `services.html`
- `about-us.html`
- `contact-us.html`

Along with associated media, CSS, and JavaScript files.

:::note[Template Definition]
In Couch, each HTML file becomes a **template**. Couch works by retrofitting into these templates, making it easy to convert any existing static HTML site with minimal effort.

## Installation

For detailed installation instructions, refer to the [**Installation Guide**](../../getting-started/installation/).

## Template Setup

:::danger[Super Admin Required]
You must be logged in as the super-admin (first account created during installation) to make these changes. The following steps will not work otherwise.
:::

After installing Couch, follow these steps to set up your templates:

<Steps>

1. **Convert to PHP**

    Since Couch is a PHP application, in order to make to your HTML templates compatible with it you need to change their extensions from `.html` or `.htm` to `.php`. For example, if `about-us.html` is a template that you wish to be managed by Couch, rename it as `about-us.php`. 
    
    Accessing the URL below should display the page exactly as it appeared with the `.html` extension:

    ```text
    https://www.yoursite.com/about-us.php
    ```

2. **Add Required Code**

    After converting the template to a `.php` file, you need to add two lines of PHP code. Open the template in a text editor (any plain text editor will work, but we recommend using [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), both are free and excellent).

    Add at the **very top** of the file:
    ```php title="Required Top Code"
    <?php require_once( 'couch/cms.php' ); ?>
    ```

    Add at the **very bottom** of the file:
    ```php title="Required Bottom Code"
    <?php COUCH::invoke(); ?>
    ```
    That is it. That is all the PHP that you'll ever need to write for using Couch.

3. **Activate Template**

    As the last step, you'll need to execute the template - that is, access it through the browser. For instance, if `about-us.php` was the template, upload it back to your server and while logged in as super-admin, navigate to the page through a browser to register it with Couch:
    
    ```text
    https://www.yoursite.com/about-us.php
    ```

</Steps>

:::danger[Important]
This is something you'll come across often - for your changes to show up in the admin panel, you'll need to run the modified template in the browser while being logged in as the super-admin.
