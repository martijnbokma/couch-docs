To upgrade from a previous version of CouchCMS to version 2.0, follow these steps:

<Steps>

1. **Extract Files**: Unzip `couchcms-2.0.zip` to your local system.
   - Inside the extracted `couchcms-2.0` folder, locate the `couch` directory.
   - Within this `couch` directory:
     - Delete the `snippets` and `uploads` folders.
     - Remove the `config.example.php` file.

2. **Prepare Existing Installation**: Rename the `ckeditor` folder in your current Couch installation's `includes` directory to `ckeditor_old` or remove it entirely.

3. **Upload New Files**: Transfer the remaining contents of the `couch` directory from step 1 to your existing installation's `couch` directory (or its renamed equivalent).
   - This process will overwrite all existing Couch core files with the new version while keeping any custom additions in the `snippets` and `uploads` folders intact.

4. **Commercial License Update**: If your website has a commercial license, add the following line to your site's `couch/config.php` file:

   ```php
   define( 'K_PAID_LICENSE', 1 );
   ```

</Steps>

:::danger[IMPORTANT]
If you have renamed the `index.php` file for security reasons, ensure you delete the existing renamed `index.php` and rename the new `index.php` to your preferred name.
