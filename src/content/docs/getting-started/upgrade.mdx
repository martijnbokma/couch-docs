Before starting the upgrade process, make sure to:

- Back up your entire website
- Back up your database
- Note down any custom modifications you've made

<Steps>

1. **Download and Extract**
   - Download the latest version from [CouchCMS.com](https://www.couchcms.com/)
   - Extract the ZIP file to your local computer
   - Inside the extracted folder, find the `couch` directory

2. **Clean Up New Files**
   Remove these from the new `couch` directory:
   - `snippets` folder
   - `uploads` folder
   - `config.example.php`

3. **Prepare Current Installation**
   In your existing CouchCMS installation:
   - Rename `couch/includes/ckeditor` to `couch/includes/ckeditor_old`
   - Make a backup of your `config.php`

4. **Upload New Files**
   - Upload all remaining files from the new `couch` directory
   - This will overwrite the core files while preserving:
     - Your `snippets` folder with custom code
     - Your `uploads` folder with media
     - Your `config.php` with settings

5. **Post-Upload Steps**
   - Delete the old `ckeditor_old` folder
   - If using a commercial license, verify in `config.php`:

     ```php title="couch/config.php"
     define( 'K_PAID_LICENSE', 1 );
     ```

   - Clear your browser cache

6. **Verify Installation**
   - Log in to the admin panel
   - Check if all your templates work
   - Verify if custom modifications still function
   - Test core features like editing and uploading

</Steps>

:::danger[Important Security Notes]

- If you renamed `index.php` for security:
  1. Delete your current renamed file
  2. Upload the new `index.php`
  3. Rename it to your secure filename
- Always maintain a backup until you've verified everything works
