Certain characters have special significance in HTML, and should be represented by HTML entities if they are to preserve their meanings. This function returns a string with some of these conversions made.

The translations performed are:

- `&` (ampersand) becomes `&amp;`
- `"` (double quote) becomes `&amp;`
- `'` (single quote) becomes `&#039;`
- `<` (less than) becomes `&lt;`
- `>` (greater than) becomes `&gt;`

As an example, the following snippet has been taken from [**Core Concepts - RSS Feeds**](../../concepts/rss-feeds.html), where we are are supplyig the feed with HTML encoded excerpt of our pages -

```php
<cms:html_encode>
    <cms:excerptHTML><cms:show my_news_text /></cms:excerptHTML>
</cms:html_encode>
```
