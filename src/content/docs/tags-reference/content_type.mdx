The `content_type` tag can be used to make the web server send back the contents with the desired Content-Type in the HTTP header.
By default every web page is send back as `text/html`.


## Basic Usage

```

Please see [Core Concepts - RSS Feeds](../../concepts/rss-feeds.html) for an example of the usage of this tag.
