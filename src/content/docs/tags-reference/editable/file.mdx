Editable region of type `file` is primarily used to allow the user to upload a file from their local computer onto the server. The user can also browse and select any of the previously uploaded files. Once a file has been selected, this editable region then holds a fully qualified URL of the uploaded file.

:::note[Default Upload Folder]
By default, all uploaded files will be saved within the `couch/uploads/file` folder (or any subfolders created by the user within it). You can set the location to any other folder by uncommenting entry number 12 (`K_UPLOAD_DIR`) in `config.php` and changing it to the desired location.

```php title="config.php"
// 12.
// Upload folder if not using the default upload folder within 'couch'.
// Should be relative to your site (don't forget to set write permissions on it).
define( 'K_UPLOAD_DIR', 'myuploads' );
```
:::

An editable region of `file` type can be defined this way:

```php title="Basic File Example"
<cms:editable
    name='my_document'
    label='Downloadable File'
    desc='Upload the file here'
    type='file'
/>
```

The code above will result in:

![Editable File Example](../../../../assets/img/contents/editable-file.gif "Editable File Example")

Clicking the **Browse Server** button will bring up a window that can be used to browse previously uploaded files on the server or upload a new file from the local machine.

The contents of this region can be accessed, as with all other editable regions, by using the variable named after it:

```php title="Accessing Uploaded File"
<a href="<cms:show my_document />" >Download file</a>
```

## Parameters

Apart from the parameters common to all the other types of editable regions, this type does not accept any other parameter.
