Editable region of type **file** is primarily used to allow the user to upload a file from his local computer onto the server. The user can also browse and select any of the previously uploaded files.
Once a file has been selected, this editable region then holds a fully qualified URL of the uploaded file.

:::note
By default, all uploaded files will be saved within the _**couch/uploads/file**_ folder (or any subfolders created by the user within it). You can set the location to any other folder by uncommenting entry number 12 (*K_UPLOAD_DIR*) in _config.php_ and changing it to the desired location.

```php title="config.php"
// 12.
// Upload folder if not using the default upload folder within 'couch'.
// Should be relative to your site (don't forget to set write permissions on it).
define( 'K_UPLOAD_DIR', 'myuploads' );
```
:::

An editable region of _file_ type can be defined this way -

```php
<cms:editable
    name='my_document'
    label='Downloadable File'
    desc='Upload the file here'
    type='file'
/>
```

The code above will result in -

Clicking the 'Browse Server' button will bring up a window which can be used to browse previously uploaded files on the server or upload a new file from the local machine.

The contents of this region can be accessed, as with all other editable regions, by using the variable named after it -

```php
<a href="<cms:show my_document />" >Download file</a>
```
