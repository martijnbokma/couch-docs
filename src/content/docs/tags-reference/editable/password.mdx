Editable region of type `password` is very similar to the [**text**](../text/) type. As with [**text**](../text/) type, for this type too Couch creates a single line textbox for data input. The only difference between the two is that anything being typed into an editable region of type `password` will appear as `*` (asterisks). This makes it suitable for entering passwords.

An editable region of type `password` can be defined this way:

```php title="Basic Password Field"
<cms:editable
    name="my_password"
    label="Password"
    desc="Enter your password"
    type="password"
/>
```

The code above will result in the following (with some password typed in):

![Password Field Example](../../../../assets/img/contents/editable-password.gif "Password field showing asterisks for input")

The contents of this region can be accessed, as with all other editable regions, by using the variable named after it:

```php title="Displaying Password Value"
<cms:show my_password />
```

## Parameters

In addition to the parameters common to all types of editable regions, `password` accepts the following parameters:

- `width`
- `maxlength`

### `width`

The width of the generated textbox can be changed by setting this parameter. For example:

```php title="Setting Password Field Width"
<cms:editable 
    name="my_password" 
    label="Password"
    desc="Enter your password"
    width="200"
    type="password" 
/>
```

This will make the textbox `200px` wide.

### `maxlength`

The maximum number of characters that can be inputted by the user in this textbox can be constrained by setting this parameter. For example:

```php title="Setting Maximum Password Length"
<cms:editable 
    name="my_password" 
    label="Password"
    desc="Enter your password"
    maxlength="40"
    type="password" 
/>
```

This will prevent the user from entering more than `40` characters.
