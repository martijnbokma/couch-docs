The `breadcrumbs` tag outputs the hierarchy of folders leading up to the folder being shown (if _folder_view_) or the folder within which the current page resides (if _page_view_). This can be used to create a trail (breadcrumbs) leading up to the current page.

```php title="Basic Usage of breadcrumbs Tag"
<cms:breadcrumbs />
```

Please see [**Core Concepts - Folders**](../../concepts/folders.html) for a discussion on this tag's usage.

## Parameters

- `separator`
- `include_template`

### `separator`

Set the separator to show between each item in the breadcrumbs. The default separator is `&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;`.

### `include_template`

By default, this tag only outputs the hierarchy of folders. To make it also list the template of the folders as the first item in the breadcrumbs, set this parameter to `1`. If this parameter is set, remember to check that the current view is either _folder-view_ or _page-view_ before invoking this tag, because for any other views the folder hierarchy is irrelevant and `breadcrumbs` tag rightly does not output any folder names, however the `include_template` parameter will cause the template's name to appear which might not be desirable.

```php title="Advanced Usage of breadcrumbs Tag"
<cms:if k_is_page || k_is_folder >
    <cms:breadcrumbs separator='&nbsp;>>&nbsp;' include_template='1' />
</cms:if>
```
