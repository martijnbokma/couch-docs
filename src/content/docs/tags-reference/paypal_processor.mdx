The `paypal_processor` tag processes PayPal IPN (Instant Payment Notification).

Please see [**Core Concepts - PayPal**](../../concepts/paypal) for an in-depth discussion of this tag.

## Parameters

- `debug`: Enable logging of processing steps
- `logfile`: Path to the log file

### `debug`

The processing of IPN by this tag is a background operation which makes it difficult to debug when issues occur. Setting this parameter to `1` enables logging of each processing step to a file (specified by the `logfile` parameter).

### `logfile`

The log file where processing steps are recorded. If omitted, a file named `log.txt` in your site's root is used (created if not existing). You can specify a path relative to the site's root.

```php title="Basic PayPal Processor"
<cms:paypal_processor debug="1" logfile="paypal.log" />
```

```php title="Secure Log File Location"
<cms:paypal_processor debug="1" logfile="couch/uploads/file/secure/paypal.log" />
```

The second example saves the log file in a protected Couch subfolder with `.htaccess` preventing direct downloads.

## Variables

PayPal provides transaction details through IPN. This tag makes these values available through the following variables:

- `pp_item_name`: Name of the purchased item
- `pp_item_number`: Item identifier
- `pp_quantity`: Quantity purchased
- `pp_mc_gross`: Transaction amount
- `pp_mc_currency`: Transaction currency
- `pp_txn_id`: PayPal transaction ID
- `pp_receiver_email`: Merchant's PayPal email
- `pp_payer_email`: Buyer's PayPal email
- `pp_first_name`: Buyer's first name
- `pp_last_name`: Buyer's last name
- `pp_payer_business_name`: Buyer's business name (if applicable)

After validation, the tag sets additional status variables:

- `k_paypal_success`: Set when transaction is valid
- `k_paypal_error`: Set when transaction is invalid

All variables normally available in the page's [**page-view**](../../concepts/variables-in-views) are also accessible.
