The `date` tag outputs a string according to the given `format` parameter using the given `date` parameter. If no `date` provided, the current time is used.


## Basic Usage

```php title="Basic Date Output"
<cms:date />
```

```php title="Using Page Date"
<cms:date k_page_date />
```

```php title="Custom Date Format"
<cms:date k_page_date format='jS M, Y' />
```


## Parameters

This tag accepts the following parameters:

- `date`
- `format`
- `gmt`
- `locale`
- `charset`


### date

The date to be formated.
This parameter is expected to be in `Y-m-d H:i:s` format (e.g. 2010-05-30 21:35:54). All date related variables set by Couch tags, e.g. `k_page_date` etc., are in this format.


### format

The `date` tag supports two different types of format characters - locale-aware and non locale-aware.
With locale-aware characters, you can specify that the date is to formatted according to, for example, `french` locale or `italian` locale by setting the `locale` parameter.
The locale-aware characters all have a % sign prefixed to them.

:::caution
The locale-aware and the non locale-aware characters cannot be intermixed.

### gmt

By setting this parameter to '1', you can get the GMT equivalent of the date provided.

### locale

If you use the locale-aware format characters mentioned above, this parameter can be set to the locale desired for formatting the provided date.

```php title="French Date Format"
<cms:date k_page_date format='%B %d, %Y' locale='french' />
```

```php title="Italian Date Format"
<cms:date k_page_date format='%B %d, %Y' locale='italian' />
```

:::caution
This feature depends entirely on the indicated locale being available at your web server. If the locale is not available, the default 'english' locale is used.
:::

### charset

Some locales do not provide their output in UTF8 character set. This causes strange ?? characters to appear in the output.
The `date` tag can help converting the output to UTF8 if you can provide it with information about the charset used by the locale.

For example:

```php title="Greek Date Format"
<cms:date k_page_date format='%B %d, %Y' locale='greek' charset='ISO-8859-7' />
```

```php title="Russian Date Format"
<cms:date k_page_date format='%B %d, %Y' locale='russian' charset='ISO-8859-5' />
```

The following is a rough list of the charset used by different languages:

**ISO-8859-1 - Latin 1**
Western Europe and Americas: Afrikaans, Basque, Catalan, Danish, Dutch, English, Faeroese, Finnish, French, Galician, German, Icelandic, Irish, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish.

**ISO-8859-2 - Latin 2**
Latin-written Slavic and Central European languages: Czech, German, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Croatian, Slovak, Slovene.

**ISO-8859-3 - Latin 3**
Esperanto, Galician, Maltese, and Turkish.

**ISO-8859-4 - Latin 4**
Scandinavia/Baltic (mostly covered by 8859-1 also): Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian. It is an incomplete predecessor of Latin 6.

**ISO-8859-5 - Cyrillic**
Bulgarian, Byelorussian, Macedonian, Russian, Serbian and Ukrainian.

**ISO-8859-6 - Arabic**
Non-accented Arabic.

**ISO-8859-7 - Modern Greek**
Greek.

**ISO-8859-8 - Hebrew**
Non-accented Hebrew.

**ISO-8859-9 - Latin 5**
Same as 8859-1 except for Turkish instead of Icelandic

**ISO-8859-10 - Latin 6**
Latin6, for Lappish/Nordic/Eskimo languages: Adds the last Inuit (Greenlandic) and Sami (Lappish) letters that were missing in Latin 4 to cover the entire Nordic area.
