The **date** tag outputs a string according to the given _format_ parameter using the given _date_ parameter. If no _date_ provided, the current time is used.

```php
<cms:date />
```

```php
<cms:date k_page_date />
```

```php
<cms:date k_page_date format='jS M, Y' />
```

## Parameters

- date
- format
- gmt
- locale
- charset

### date

The date to be formated.
This parameter is expected to be in '_Y-m-d H:i:s_' format (e.g. 2010-05-30 21:35:54). All date related variables set by Couch tags, e.g. _k_page_date_ etc., are in this format.

### format

The **date** tag supports two different types of format characters - locale-aware and non locale-aware.
With locale-aware characters, you can specify that the date is to formatted according to, for example, _french_ locale or _italian_ locale by setting the _locale_ parameter.
The locale-aware characters all have a % sign prefixed to them.

:::caution
The locale-aware and the non locale-aware characters cannot be intermixed.

### gmt

By setting this parameter to '1', you can get the GMT equivalent of the date provided.

### locale

If you use the locale-aware format characters mentioned above, this parameter can be set to the locale desired for formatting the provided date.

```php
<cms:date k_page_date format='%B %d, %Y' locale='french' />
```

```php
<cms:date k_page_date format='%B %d, %Y' locale='italian' />
```

:::caution
This feature depends entirely on the indicated locale being available at your web server. If the locale is not available, the default 'english' locale is used.
:::

### charset

Some locales do not provide their output in UTF8 character set. This causes strange ?? characters to appear in the output.
The **date** tag can help converting the output to UTF8 if you can provide it with information about the charset used by the locale.

For example -

```php
<cms:date k_page_date format='%B %d, %Y' locale='greek' charset='ISO-8859-7' />
```

```php
<cms:date k_page_date format='%B %d, %Y' locale='russian' charset='ISO-8859-5' />
```

The following is a rough list of the charset used by different languages -

**ISO-8859-1 - Latin 1**
Western Europe and Americas: Afrikaans, Basque, Catalan, Danish, Dutch, English, Faeroese, Finnish, French, Galician, German, Icelandic, Irish, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish.

**ISO-8859-2 - Latin 2**
Latin-written Slavic and Central European languages: Czech, German, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Croatian, Slovak, Slovene.

**ISO-8859-3 - Latin 3**

**ISO-8859-4 - Latin 4**
Scandinavia/Baltic (mostly covered by 8859-1 also): Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian. It is an incomplete predecessor of Latin 6\.

**ISO-8859-5 - Cyrillic**

**ISO-8859-6 - Arabic**
Non-accented Arabic.

**ISO-8859-7 - Modern Greek**
Greek.

**ISO-8859-8 - Hebrew**
