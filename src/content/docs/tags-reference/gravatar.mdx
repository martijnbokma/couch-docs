Given an email address, the **gravatar** tag outputs an HTML `<img>` tag (or link only). The source of this image is set to the Gravatar image registered for this email at _gravatar.com_. If the email is not registered, the default image is output.

```php
<cms:gravatar email="johndoe@gmail.com" size="60" />
```

## Parameters

- email
- size
- default
- link_only

If set to '1', output the image link only (i.e. not the `<img>` tag).
