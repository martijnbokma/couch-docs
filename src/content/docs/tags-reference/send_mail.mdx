The **send_mail** tag, as the name suggests, can be used to send emails.

```php
<cms:send_mail from='admin@mysite.com' to='johndoe@gmail.com' subject='Feedback from your site'>
Anything here (between the opening and closing tags of send_mail)
will form the body of the email that will be sent.
</cms:send_mail>
```

Anything enclosed within the opening and closing tags will form the body of the message to be sent.
Each line should be separated with a LF (\n). Lines should not be larger than 70 characters.
