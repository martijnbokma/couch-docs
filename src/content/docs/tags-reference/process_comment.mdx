The **process_comment** tag is meant to be used at the successful submission of a comments form.
It simply tries to insert the submitted comment into the database. If it is successful in inserting the comment, the tag sets the _k_process_comment_success_ variable otherwise it sets the _k_process_comment_error_ variable in the context of its parent tag.

Please see [**Core Concepts - Comments**](../../concepts/using-comments.html) for an example of this tag's usage.
