keywords: [set, tag, PHP, variables, scope, data storage, template variables]
---

The **Set** tag is used to put some value in a variable. The variable, if not already present, is created.
(This tag is the counterpart of [**Show**](../show.html) tag which is used to display set variables)

The following example will create a variable called 'greeting' and set its value to 'Hello'

```php
<cms:set greeting='Hello' />
```

The following will create another variable known as 'message' and set its value to 'Hello'

```php
<cms:set message=greeting />
```

As with all other tags, nested tags may be used in parameters (taking care to use double quotes).
The following will set the value of 'message' to 'Hello World'.
```php
<cms:set message="<cms:show greeting /> World" />
```

A valid variable name starts with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores.

:::note[Important]
**Set** cannot be used to set system variables (i.e. those that begin with prefix 'k_').

## Parameters

The first parameter, as illustrated above, is mandatory and is used to set a named variable to a certain value.
The tag also uses an optional unnamed (i.e. only the value can be provided) second parameter that defines the **scope** within which the variable will be set.

```php
<cms:set message='hello' scope='global' />
```

The above is the same as

```php
<cms:set message='hello' 'global' />
```

Here 'global' defines the scope of 'message' variable

The valid values for this second parameter are -

*   local
*   parent
*   global

## Variables

This tag does not set any variables of its own.
