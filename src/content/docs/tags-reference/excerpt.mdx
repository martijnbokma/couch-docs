The **excerpt** tag can be used to create an excerpt of any content that is enclosed within its opening and closing tags.
Unlike the **excerptHTML** tag, the **excerpt** tag strips off all HTML tags (except those specified by its _allow_ parameter) from the excerpt it creates.

## Parameters

- count
- allow
- trail
- truncate_chars

### count

The maximum number of words/characters that the excerpt can contain. The default value is 50\.
By default, this parameter is applied to the number of words in the excerpt.
By setting the 'truncate_chars' parameter (see below) to '1', it can be made to apply to the number of characters in the excerpt instead.

### allow

The HTML elements you wish to preserve in the excerpt.
If you wish to preserve multiple tags, separate the tagnames by using comma e.g.

```php
allow='i, b'
```

### trail

By default the produced excerpt is appended with '...' (three ellipses). You can change this by using this parameter.

### truncate_chars

By default, the 'count' paramater is considered to be the number of words the excerpt can contain.
By setting the 'truncate_chars' to '1', the 'count' becomes the number of characters the excerpt can contain.

```php
<cms:excerpt count='100' truncate_chars='1'>...blah blah...</cms:excerpt>
```

:::note
Please note that if 'truncate_chars' is set to '1', the 'allow' parameter is ignored and all the HTML tags are stripped off the input.
