## What makes CouchCMS perfect for web designers?


<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="No Knowledge of PHP Expected!" icon="seti:php">
		Take any HTML design you have created, add some familiar XHTML like Couch tags into it and make it CMS managed within minutes.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Your Markup Remains Untouched" icon="seti:html">
		Add Couch does not add a single byte of its own markup into your design. The CMSified site remains 100% fidel to your original static design.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Clients Love the Simple Admin Panel" icon="heart">
		Couch gives you an absolutely blank admin-panel to begin with. Add to it only the elements that are editable by the clients.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Simple But Not For Only Simple Sites!" icon="rocket">
		Use Couch's powerful features like `relations`, `saving form submissions into database`, `custom routes` etc. to create sites that would otherwise require you to be a PHP Ninja!
	</Card>
	<Card title="Time-Tested and Secure" icon="seti:clock">
		Couch has been around for nearly six years now and is used by thousands of sites world-wide. You can trust it to keep your site safe from web hacks like XSS, CSRF etc.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Open Source and Free!" icon="seti:github">
		You get all this for free! Compare it to similar commercial solutions that will cost you anything from $100 to $300. In case you happen to need it, support is only a call away.
