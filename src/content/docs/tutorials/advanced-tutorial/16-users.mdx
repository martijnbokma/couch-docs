# Users

The finished Notejam application will allow visitors to register their accounts from the front-end, manage their
profile, reclaim lost passwords etc. (i.e. all the paraphernalia that is usually associated with a membership site).

As already explained at the outset of this tutorial, we are using the 'extended-users' module
([Extended Users](https://github.com/trendoman/Midware/tree/main/concepts/Extended-Users#extended-users)) to implement
the mentioned functionalities.

So far, we have made use of only one of the functionalities offered by that module - the creation of users using a
custom template. The config file in `couch/addons/extended`, as it exists at this point, shows the fact -

```php config
// Names of the required templates
$t['users_tpl'] = 'users/index.php';
$t['login_tpl'] = '';
$t['lost_password_tpl'] = '';
$t['registration_tpl'] = '';
```

To put the rest of the functionalities in place, please use the tutorial here -
[Extended Users » User accounts](https://github.com/trendoman/Midware/tree/main/concepts/Extended-Users#user-accounts).

With that we can now finally wrap up this tutorial.
