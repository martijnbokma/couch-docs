The finished Notejam application will allow visitors to register their accounts from the front-end, manage their profile, reclaim lost passwords etc. (i.e. all the paraphernalia that is usually associated with a membership site).

As already explained at the outset of this tutorial, we are using the 'extended-users' module ([Extended Users](../../concepts/extended-users)) to implement the mentioned functionalities.

## Current Implementation

So far, we have made use of only one of the functionalities offered by that module - the creation of users using a custom template. The config file in `couch/addons/extended`, as it exists at this point, shows the fact:

```php title="couch/addons/extended/config.php - Extended Users Configuration"
// Names of the required templates
$t['users_tpl'] = 'users/index.php';
$t['login_tpl'] = '';
$t['lost_password_tpl'] = '';
$t['registration_tpl'] = '';
```

## Next Steps

To put the rest of the functionalities in place, please refer to the [Extended Users » User accounts](../../concepts/extended-users#user-accounts) documentation.

With that we can now finally wrap up this tutorial.
