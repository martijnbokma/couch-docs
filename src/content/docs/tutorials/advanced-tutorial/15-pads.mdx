The good thing about the 'Pads' section is that it is almost a copy of the [Notes section](./04-notes) that we've already studied in excruciating detail.

So, instead of hand-holding you through its template and view snippets, I'll encourage you to take a look at the source files yourselves. There shouldn't be a single point in there that we haven't already covered and so you should really find everything easy.

## Implementation Structure

Begin from the `pads.php` template examining the routes defining its various views. Then move over to the `snippets/views/pads` folder to take a look at the snippets implementing those views.

## Key Differences

Let me highlight the few minor points that are slightly different in this section:

### View Structure

1. You won't find a `list_view`. It isn't required for pads as we list all the pads in the sidebar of the 'notes' section.

2. The `page_view` of pads, instead of showing details of a single pad, shows all the notes belonging to that pad. So it is almost identical to the `list_view` of notes.

## Next Steps

We'll now take a look at the final section of Notejam - Users.
