Click on the 'New note' button and you'll reach this view. It displays a form that can be used to create a new note:

![Create Note Form](./img/scr3.png)

## Basic Structure

So we'll now concentrate only on `views/notes/create_view.html`. Open the file up in your editor and you'll recognize
the general outline followed by all other views:

```php title="views/notes/create_view.html"
<cms:set my_title='New note' />

<cms:capture into='my_content'>
    ... bulk of the code here ...
</cms:capture>

<cms:embed 'views/layout_with_sidebar.html' />
```

## Form Implementation

The code within the `cms:capture` block is what interests us. It consists entirely of a single `cms:form` block:

```php title="views/notes/create_view.html - Form Block"
<cms:form
    masterpage=k_template_name
    mode='create'
    enctype='multipart/form-data'
    method='post'
    class="note"
    anchor='0'>

    ...
    ...

</cms:form>
```

If you are familiar with [DataBound Forms](../../../concepts/databound-forms) (as expected for this tutorial), you'll recognize that this form is bound to the current template (`notes.php`) and is meant to create a new cloned page of the template.

## Form Fields

Following is how the three inputs seen in the screenshot above are defined in the snippet:

```php title="views/notes/create_view.html - Form Inputs"
<label for="name">Name</label>
<cms:input type="text" name='name' id="name" required='1' />

<label for="text">Note</label>
<cms:input type='bound' name='content' id="text"></cms:input>

...
...

<label for="list">Select Pad</label>
<cms:input
    type='dropdown'
    name='pad'
    id='list'
    opt_values=my_opt_values
    opt_selected=my_current_pad
    required='1'
/>
```

## Form Processing

You'll notice that only one of the three inputs is of type 'bound' (the 'content'). The other two are regular inputs
used in normal forms. That is perfectly fine as we'll explicitly feed the values selected in them to the
`cms:db_persist_form` tag that actually creates the new page in the form's success condition:

```php title="views/notes/create_view.html - Form Persistence"
<cms:if k_success>
    <cms:db_persist_form
        k_page_title=frm_name
        k_page_name="<cms:random_name />"
        note_pad=frm_pad
        note_owner=k_user_id
    />
    ...
</cms:if>
```

## Understanding Input Types

You'll recognize above that the 'frm_name' and 'frm_pad' being used to set the 'k_page_title' and 'note_pad' fields of
note represent our form's non-bound `cms:input`.

### Regular vs Bound Inputs

You might well ask here why we did not use these two inputs in 'bound' mode? The reason for 'name' is mainly cosmetic.
The 'bound' input uses the styling of admin-panel and stretches 99% width of the screen. We could have used CSS to make
it look the way we want but I simply chose to use a non-bound `cms:input` instead.

### Dynamic Dropdown Implementation

The answer for the 'dropdown' input showing the pads is more compelling -

this dropdown, in bound mode (i.e. as seen in the admin-panel), shows *all* the pads in the application. We, on the
other hand, want to display only those pads that belong to the logged-in user. To do so, we use a non-bound dropdown
explicitly feeding it only the pads belonging to the user to show as list-items.

How we do this might be interesting to you.

#### Static vs Dynamic Dropdown

If suppose following is the definition of a dropdown:

```php title="Example - Static Dropdown"
<cms:input
    type='dropdown'
    name='pad'
    opt_values='Personal=3 | Business=5 | Sports=10'
    opt_selected='5'
    required='1'
/>
```

It should be easy to see that the dropdown will display three items with the 'Business' item being in the selected
state.

Now compare the definition above with how we have actually defined the 'pad' dropdown:

```php title="views/notes/create_view.html - Dynamic Dropdown"
<cms:input
    type='dropdown'
    name='pad'
    id='list'
    opt_values=my_opt_values
    opt_selected=my_current_pad
    required='1'
/>
```

#### Dynamic Options Generation

You'll notice that instead of providing explicit values for 'opt_values' and 'opt_selected', we are using variables
instead.

The portion of the code that sets the 'my_opt_values' variable is this:

```php title="views/notes/create_view.html - Dynamic Options"
<cms:capture into='my_opt_values'>
    Please Select=-
    <cms:pages masterpage='pads.php' custom_field="pad_owner=<cms:show k_user_name />">
       | <cms:show k_page_title />=<cms:show k_page_id />
    </cms:pages>
</cms:capture>
```

The code above simply uses `cms:pages` to fetch all pads that are related to the current logged-in user and then
stuffs their names and IDs (separated by '|') into the 'my_opt_values' variable. This shows to the user only the pads
that she created.

## Pre-selected Values

Please take a look at the 'opt_selected' parameter. We use it to show one of the pads in the list above as pre-selected.
As can be seen, instead of a hard-coded value, we are using a variable named 'my_current_pad' for this.

If you take a look at the snippet again and you'll find that this 'my_current_pad' is not set anywhere. Actually this
will be done by the 'create_with_pad_view' we'll discuss next. For the create_view being currently discussed, this
variable always remains empty and so no pad is shown in a selected state in this view.

## Form Submission

The last element in the form is the submit button:

```html
<input type="submit" value="Save">
```

which triggers the submission of the form.

### Success Handler

Upon successful submission, the `k_success` block executes and it is here that the `cms:db_persist_form` tag creates
a new note using the submitted values:

```php title="views/notes/create_view.html - Success Handler"
<cms:if k_success>
    <cms:db_persist_form
        k_page_title=frm_name
        k_page_name="<cms:random_name />"
        note_pad=frm_pad
        note_owner=k_user_id
    />

    <cms:if "<cms:not k_persist_error />">
        <cms:redirect "<cms:route_link 'page_view' rt_id=k_last_insert_id />" />
    </cms:if>
</cms:if>
```

### User Association

Notice how we are associating the current logged-in user to the new note by setting:

```php
note_owner=k_user_id
```

### Page Name Generation

Notice also how we are setting the `k_page_name` (a required field for any cloned page) to a random name:

```php
k_page_name="<cms:random_name />"
```

### Redirect After Success

If the creation process completes without any error, we redirect the user to the 'page_view' of the note we just created
(the 'k_last_insert_id' variable made available by `cms:db_persist_form` contains its ID):

```php
<cms:if "<cms:not k_persist_error />">
    <cms:redirect "<cms:route_link 'page_view' rt_id=k_last_insert_id />" />
</cms:if>
```

## Next Steps

So that brings us to the end of the 'create_view'. Next we'll take a look at the 'create_with_pad_view' which actually
'piggy-backs' on the create view we just discussed.
