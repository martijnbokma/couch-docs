To demonstrate the power and ease of Couch, we'll build a complete real world site from scratch using it.

## The Aurelius Template

The template we have chosen is Aurelius. It was originally created to be sold commercially at Themeforest. However, the author later released it as a free template.

We chose this template because it has almost all the sections you'll commonly need in a website:

- About Us
- Portfolio
- Blog
- Contact Us
- Home

<Card icon="download" title="Download Template">
You can download Aurelius from:
- [Free CSS Templates](https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page116/aurelius)
- [Our Optimized Version](https://www.couchcms.com/docs/code/Aurelius.zip) (unnecessary files removed)

## Installation Steps

### Setting Up Aurelius

Couch works by retrofitting within an existing working site. As such, our first step will be to get the static Aurelius site working.

<Steps>
1. Unzip and upload all the files of Aurelius to your web server.

    :::note
    You can use any hosted space that you might have for the purpose of this tutorial. However that would entail FTP'ing the modified files back to the server every time you make any changes.

    A more pragmatic approach would be to use [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html) or [WampServer](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) on your local machine. This way you can directly make changes to local files.

    For macOS users, you can use [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) which provides similar functionality.

    For this tutorial, we'll assume that your web server is hosted locally and hence will simply say 'edit this file and save it' instead of 'edit this file locally and FTP it back to your server'.
    :::

3. If using files from 'free-css.com', remove `full_width.html` as it won't be needed.

4. Your folder structure should look like this:
   <FileTree>
   - css/
   - images/
   - js/
   - about.html
   - blog.html
   - contact.html
   - index.html
   - portfolio.html
   - portfolio_single.html
   - single.html
   </FileTree>

5. Confirm all pages are accessible through your browser.
</Steps>

### Installing CouchCMS

<Steps>
1. **Download CouchCMS**
   - Visit [couchcms.com](https://www.couchcms.com)
   - Download the latest version
   - Alternatively, get it from [GitHub](https://github.com/couchcms/couchcms/releases)

2. **Extract Files**
   - Unzip `couch.zip` to get the following structure:
   <FileTree>
   - addons/
   - auth/
   - cache/
   - includes/
   - lang/
   - parser/
   - snippets/
   - theme/
   - uploads/
   - _index.php
   - ajax.php
   - base.php
   - captcha.php
   - cms.php
   - comment.php
   - conditional-fields.php
   - config.example.php
   - config.php
   - couchcms-logo.gif
   - db.php
   - download.php
   - edit-comments.php
   - edit-drafts.php
   - edit-folders.php
   - edit-pages.php
   - edit-users.php
   - event.php
   - field.php
   - folder.php
   - forgotpassword.php
   - functions.php
   - gen_dump.php
   - gen_htaccess.php
   - header.php
   - index.php
   - install.php
   - LICENSE.txt
   - login.php
   - page.php
   - restore_dump.php
   - route.php
   - search.php
   - tags.php
   - upgrade.php
   - upload.php
   - uploader.php
   </FileTree>

3. **Configure CouchCMS**
   - Rename `config.example.php` to `config.php`
   - Change the values to match those of your MySQL database:
    ```php "database_name" "database_username" "database_password" "localhost"
    // MySQL settings. You need to get this info from your web host.
    // 4.
    // Name of the database
    define( 'K_DB_NAME', 'database_name' );
    // 5.
    // Database username
    define( 'K_DB_USER', 'database_username' );
    // 6.
    // Database password
    define( 'K_DB_PASSWORD', 'database_password' );
    // 7.
    // MySQL hostname (it will usually be 'localhost')
    define( 'K_DB_HOST', 'localhost' );
    ```

4. **Upload Files**
   - Upload the entire *couch* folder, along with the modified `config.php`, to your web server, which already contains the Aurelius files.
   - The resulting site structure should now look like this with the *couch* folder appearing as a subfolder of your existing site:

   Upload the 'couch' folder to your web server alongside Aurelius files:
   <FileTree>
   - **couch/**
   - css/
   - images/
   - js/
   - about.html
   - blog.html
   - contact.html
   - index.html
   - portfolio.html
   - portfolio_single.html
   - single.html
   </FileTree>

    :::note
    The uploaded *couch* folder is your site's admin section.
    It is a good security measure to rename this folder to anything else you wish. This way you'll make it more difficult for unwanted visitors to try and access your admin section.
    For this tutorial we'll assume you have chosen to go with the default name.
    :::

5. **Run Installation**
   - Access the admin section: 
   ```txt
   https://www.mytestsite.com/couch/
   ```

    :::note
    For the rest of this tutorial we'll assume the site's address to be `https://www.mytestsite.com/`. Replace it with your site's address for all examples.
    :::

    Couch will sense that installation is required and will display the following form for you to fill:
    
    ![Installation Form](../../../../assets/img/contents/portfolio-site-5.jpg)

    :::caution
    If you get a '500 Internal Server Error', try deleting the `.htaccess` file in the *couch* folder. Some hosts (notably GoDaddy) have issues with its directives.
    :::
    
    Fill in:
    - Your desired 'Super-Admin Username'
    - Password
    - Email address

    Press install and in a little while you should be prompted with the following screen:

    ![Login Screen](../../../../assets/img/contents/portfolio-site-6.jpg)

    Couch created an account with super-admin privilege using the information provided by you in the last step and is now prompting you to login using the same.

    :::danger[Very Important]
    This account created for you by Couch is a very special one. This is the account you need to be logged in with, whenever you wish to make any 'structural' changes to the website as a designer - (which, for the site we are building now, is the entire duration of this tutorial).

    Only one such account can ever exist in one installation of Couch. Be sure to provide a valid email address during installation so that it could be used in password recovery if you happen to forget this account's password.
    :::

8. **Access Admin Panel**
    
    Login using the super-admin account you created and brace yourself for facing the most 'barren' admin section you'll ever come across:
   
   ![Initial Admin Panel](../../../../assets/img/contents/portfolio-site-7.jpg)

   This almost bare admin panel is an important feature of Couch. We realize that the person most often logged into it is going to be the client that you'll be building the website for and, more often than not, he is not going to be as computer savvy as you are. Instead of overwhelming such a client with an admin panel that resembles the cockpit of an airliner, we wished to confront him with just as much information as is absolutely essential. As we move along with building the site, the admin panel will start displaying more information. This is the admin panel of our finished site:
   
   ![Completed Admin Panel](../../../../assets/img/contents/portfolio-site-8.png)

   :::note
   It is important to note that the admin panels of no two sites built with Couch are going to be identical. As the designer of a website, it is you who'll choose how much data gets exposed to the client within the admin section.
   :::
</Steps>

With CouchCMS installed, we can now begin converting the Aurelius template files.
